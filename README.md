# About Stock Overflow
Stock Overflow has two main components: the website, and the game. The overarching goal of Stock Overflow is to promote financial literacy in Canadians starting at a young age. The website aims to educate the reader by giving key terms, explaining the importance of investing and how to begin investing. At the bottom of the webpage is a button where you can download our game Stock Overflow to further your education. The game has animations that portray a story of the misconception of investing, and that it doesn;t have to be difficult. Then after the animation, there is a quiz to consolidate the user's knowledge. Then following the quiz is a basic stock analysis page where users can enter stock tickers and see the past year data trends, the average price, the line of best fit and other information to help begin their investing career.
