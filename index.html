	<h2 class="subheader-text"><u>Open a TFSA:</u></h2>
	<h3 class="paragraph-text">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Majority of new investors should consider themselves long term investors and expect to hold stocks for longer than one year. When you turn 18 you should open up a TFSA at a financial institution such as RBC, Scotia Bank or Sun Life Financial. A TFSA is a tax-free savings account that allows you to earn money on investments and not pay any tax on them, even when withdrawn. A TFSA has a maximum contribution which changes every year, in 2020 the maximum contribution limit is $6000. However, these values carry over every year once you turn 18, so if you never contributed to your TFSA and you are 20, you can contribute a maximum of the sum of the contribution limits in 2018, 2019 and 2020.</h3>

	<h2 class="subheader-text"><u>Portfolio Options:</u></h2>
	<h3 class="paragraph-text">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;After your TFSA is open you can choose either a self-directed investing option or a non-self-directed option. Non-self-directed options allow others to invest your money for you, but generally charging an annual fee to do so. Self-directed options allow you to control what and when you buy and sell on the stock market. As a beginner investor, you should primarily invest in ETFs and index funds which is are a basket of different companies in similar industries that you can buy to reduce your risk if one company fails, these are generally considered the most safe investments. Additionally, you can invest in a medium size portion into individual blue-chip stocks that are generally safe and likely pay a good dividend yield such as: bank stocks, utility stocks and railway stocks. These are more risky as they do you are buying the individual companies unlike a basket of companies as in an ETF. As well, if you like risk, a small portion of your portfolio can be growth-oriented stocks which are high risk, high reward. These are stocks you believe are undervalued and will go up in price soon. A portfolio composition of 80% blue chip and 20% growth stocks is considered a healthy balance for a new investor.</h3>

	<h2 class="subheader-text"><u>Long Term Investor:</u></h2>
	<h3 class="paragraph-text">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As a new investor you should consider yourself a long-term investor, if a stock has a bad day don't immediatley panic sell. There is a general upward trend in the S&P 500 index, as in the past decade has given an annual return of 13.6%, so one bad day doesn't really matter. Compound interest is another key idea, as when you leave your money in an investment for a long time and it payd dividents, you can reinvest those dividends to even more morey and dividends. So, the longer you hold a stock for, the more compound interest you can earn!</h3>
